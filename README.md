# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction-Using-CatBoost

Link to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction

  The goal is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting
infected by various families of malware using CatBoost based on different
properties of that machine generated by telemetry data of Windows Defender.

  CatBoost is a state-of-the-art open-source gradient
boosting on decision trees library. Developed by Yandex
researchers and engineers, it is the successor of the
MatrixNet algorithm that is widely used within the
company for ranking tasks, forecasting and making
recommendations. It is universal and can be applied across
a wide range of areas and to a variety of problems.

<ul>
  <li>Accurate: leads or ties competition on standard
  benchmarks</li>
  <li>Robust: reduces the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning</li>
  <li>Easy-to-use: offers Python interfaces integrated with 
    scikit, as well as R and command-line interfaces</li>
  <li>Practical: uses categorical features directly and
    scalably</li>
  <li>Extensible: allows specifying custom loss functions</li>
 </ul>
  
  Since this is a Kaggle competition, the output of the
model is evaluated by Kaggle. There are two leaderboards
in Kaggle namely public and private leaderboard. The
private leaderboard is calculated with approximately 37%
of the test data for this competition. This leaderboard is
calculated with approximately 63% of the test data.

Private Score: 0.64949 <br>
Public Score: 0.65380
